# Used the NS-2 network simulator to perform experiments on TCP variants (Tahoe, Reno, NewReno, Vegas) under various congestion, 
  in terms of average application layer throughput or TCP goodput, dropped packet rate and latency
  
#  The network topologies were designed using TCL scripts and trace files were parsed using Python.
