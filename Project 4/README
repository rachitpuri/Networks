Run

./rawhttpget [URL]

Approach

1. First 3-way handshake is performed with the server by setting SYN / ACK bits in TCP packet
2. Once Handshake is successful, clients sends the HTTP request to server and waits for its ACK
3. Then clients keeps receiving the incoming packet from the server and check the following conditions:
   3.1 Is the source and destination port of incoming packet correct
   3.2 Is FIN flag set in the packet
4. After successfully receiving each packet, clients sends the ACK to the server
5. Execution stops when the server sends the disconnect request by setting FIN flag
6. Client sends the FIN + ACK packet to server and finally closes all the opened connections

Challenges

1. The biggest challenge was to properly update the Seq number and Ack number. Even a slight mistake could
   make errors in packet handling
2. Understanding the complete packet structure of TCP and IP and how to extract fields from it when incoming packet arrives
3. Calculating the checksum for TCP and IP
4. Handling Timeout, Checksum errors
5. Wireshark was pretty useful to analyse the packets in-depth and finding mistakes in packet.
